# Average-calculations

print("This program claculates the average of two numbers.")

number1 = float(input("Please enter the first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Please enter the second number: "))
# float() takes into account decimals and makes average calculations easier

print("The numbers are", number1, "and", number2)
print("The average is: ", (number1 + number2)/2)
# can put number1 and number2 values instead of "" values for refinement and tidier look
